                        <p>From Little Mix's eagerly awaited fifth album to the debut of Anne-Marie's 'Speak Your Mind', we genuinely can't wait for all the new music that's about to fill the airwaves.</p>

                        <p>The last time Selena Gomez released a full studio album was back in 2015 with her platinum selling LP 'Revival' and now it is finally time for Sel to head back into the studio. We've already had new music in 2017 with her Marshmello collab 'Wolves' and 'Fetish' feat. Gucci Mane, a 2018 album seems a dead cert!</p>

                        <p>Ariana's 2016 'Dangerous Woman' featured blockbuster hits such as 'Into You' and 'Side To Side' featuring Nicki Minaj so of course when Ari posted this video on the last day of 2017 our minds started jumping to ALL sorts of conclusions.And then, finally, out of nowhere. Ariana dropped her comeback single 'No Tear Left To Cry' and the world was set to rights once again.</p>

Early in January Shawn vowed to finish the album by the end of the month, just... YAY!</p>
